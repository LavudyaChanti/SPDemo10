GIT:
==

Git is an indispensable part of modern software development. 
It is a version control system which can be thought of as an extremely powerful version of track changes 
in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. 


With git, 
you can collaborate with other developers, 
track all your work via commits,
revert to any previous version of your code even if you accidentally delete something important.

Installation & setup:
=================
1.Install Git On Windows.
2.Once installed, we need to do a one-time system setup to configure it 
by declaring the name and email address you want associated with all your Git commits.

3.Within the command line console type the following two lines. 
Make sure to update them your name and email address.

4.Open cmd prompt

c:\> 	git 	config --global user.name "Your Name"
c:\>  	git 	config --global user.email "yourname@email.com"

5.You can always change these configs later if you desire by retyping the same commands 
with a new name or email address.





Configuring ur project into git:
==========================
Step1:Open ur project folder
Step2:Open cmd prompt
Step3:Prepare ur project code in Eclipse & test it then goto cmd prompt
Step4:one-time system setup to configure git(creating account)
	git 	config --global user.name "Your Name"	
	git 	config --global user.email "yourname@email.com"
Step5:
The first step is to initialize (or add) git to our repository.
	git 	init
Step6:
If you then type git status you’ll see a list of changes since the last git commit. 
Since this is our first commit, this list is all of our changes so far.
	git status
Step7:
We next want to add all changes by using the command add -A and then commit the 
changes along with a message describing what has changed.
	git add -A
	git commit -m 'initial commit'
Step8:
	SignIn into ur github account from Browser
Step9:	
	Click new in Repositories
Step10:
	name=UrAppName
	Click on create Repository

Step11:Goto "push an existing repository from the command line" and copy the                               two commands & paste  into ur command prompt

Command1:git remote add origin https://github.com/LavudyaChanti/UrAppName.git
Command2:git push -u origin master

Step12:Goto homepage in github site & check ur project
Step13:Next time if u modified code then repeat Step5,6,7 & Step11 command2
